To troubleshoot and resolve the issue of charts not updating in real-time as new data arrives from the API in a ReactJS and Tailwind CSS dashboard, you can follow these steps:

1. Check API Response:
Check if the API is returning the updated data correctly. Have to use tools like Postman or Hopscotch to inspect the API response.
I can also do that by using browser inspect or by console.log fucntion

2. Event Source or WebSocket:
For realtime data use web socket like (Socket IO) isntead of Server-Sent Events.

3. State Management (useState):
Confirm that the component's state is being updated with the new data. Sometimes react state needs to re-rendered, or sometimes needs some time to change.

4. React Hooks(useEffect):
Ensure that React Hooks (useEffect) are being used appropriately. The useEffect hook is crucial for handling side effects such as fetching data and updating the state.
When new data is fetched run useEffect to change state of the variable and graphs.

5. Memory Leaks:
Continuous data fetching without proper cleanup can lead to memory leaks. Make sure to clean up any resources (such as event listeners or subscriptions) in the useEffect cleanup function.

6. Other problems
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues with the API.
Network errors or latency causing delays in data retrieval.
